# Douglas's Portfolio

## [Project 1: Uber Trips 2016](https://github.com/dougmart/Uber_2016_OrdUser)
* Data analysis of uber trips made by an ordinary user on year 2016

## [Project 2: Filmow Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/dougmart/FilmowPredict)
* Created a tool that estimates what rate the person should give to a random movie based on the ratings he/she already gave to other movies
* Scrapped the movies the person already saw and rated
* Data analysis to have insights of user preferences
* Prediction of what rate the user will give to a new movie
* Tunning of the selected methods to get the best result using searchGridCV

## [Project 3: Demand Analysis and Forecasting](https://github.com/dougmart/ProductDemandAnalyForec)
* Collected from SQL Database the demand of a specific product (1 year history data)
* Time series analysis to have some insights of how is the behavior of the product's demand
* Forecasting of how the demand should be the next month

## [Project 4: Clustering Customers vs Sales Representatives](https://github.com/dougmart/CustomerClusteringDan)
* Cluster the customers into smaller groups so they can be better divided into the group of sales representatives
* Used Elbow Method to decide the best number of clusters
* Used the analysis' result as input to route scheduling

## [Project 5: Route Optimizer](https://github.com/dougmart/RouteOptimizerMILP)
* Created an optimizer to be used on routing of small datasets
* Used KMeans to cluster the addresses based on distance
* Used Mixed-Integer Linear Programming to solve the optimization problem
* Could find an optimal solution for small datasets in less than 30 seconds
* Prog. Language: Julia

## [Project 6: Surgery Sequencer](https://github.com/dougmart/SurgerySeq)
* Designed an algorithm to sequence surgeries on different surgery rooms based on their priority and resource needs
* Used Pandas to explore all possibilities on the library
* Three methods for priorities: Shortest Surgery First, Longest Surgery First and Surgery Priority
